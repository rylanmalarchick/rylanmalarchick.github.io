## Quantum Computing & High-Performance Computing Research

I'm a 3rd-year undergraduate at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University pursuing an accelerated BS/MS in Engineering Physics with a Spacecraft Instrumentation track and Computational Math minor (expected May 2027).

My research focuses on quantum algorithms, quantum control, and high-performance computing. I build tools that bridge the gap between theoretical quantum computing and practical implementation on real hardware.

## Key Results

- **117x speedup** on GPU-accelerated quantum chemistry simulations (VQE on 4x NVIDIA H100)
- **99.14% gate fidelity** in quantum optimal control simulations using GRAPE
- **R² = 0.744** for ML-based cloud retrieval, outperforming CNNs by 130%

## Current Research

### Quantum Computing
- **QubitPulseOpt**: Quantum gate optimization using GRAPE with Lindblad noise modeling. Achieved 99.14% X-gate fidelity in 20ns simulations. [arXiv preprint, Dec 2025]
- **High-Performance VQE**: GPU-accelerated Variational Quantum Eigensolver achieving 117x speedup through JIT compilation, multi-GPU scaling, and MPI parallelization on ERAU's Vega HPC cluster.

### Machine Learning for Atmospheric Science
