## Engineering Physics & Quantum Control

I'm currently studying Engineering Physics at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, focusing on spacecraft instrumentation and quantum control systems. My work sits at the intersection of theoretical physics, hardware engineering, and software optimization.

## Current Focus

Right now, I'm building open-source quantum control systems and FPGA accelerators. The goal is to make quantum computing research more accessible by creating tools that bridge the gap between simulation and real hardware.

### QubitPulseOpt

My main project is a Python framework for quantum optimal control using the GRAPE (Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering) algorithm. It demonstrates 99.14% fidelity in closed-loop simulation and serves as a foundation for hardware implementation.

### FPGA Quantum Emulator

I'm transitioning from pure software simulation to Hardware-in-the-Loop using the Lattice ECP5 FPGA. The bottleneck of CPU-based matrix multiplication makes real-time RF pulse generation impractical, so I'm developing a "headless" architecture that pushes computation to dedicated hardware.

## Research Interests

- Quantum optimal control & pulse shaping
- FPGA-accelerated scientific computing
- Spacecraft instrumentation & embedded systems
- Real-time signal processing for quantum systems
